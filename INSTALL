Installation Instructions for Package rBLAST

1. Install BLAST+
The BLAST+ software needs to be installed on your system. The software for
different operating systems is available at:
    https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

A precombiled software package is already available for many Linux distributions.
The package is typically called ‚Å†ncbi-blast+. For example in Debian/Ubuntu, the
package can be installed using the APT package manager:
    apt-get install ncbi-blast+

2. Setting the Path Environment Variable
R needs to be able to find the executable. This is mostly only an issue with
Windows. After installing the software, try in R Sys.which("blastn") to see if
the program can be found. If the command returns "" instead of the path to the
executable, then you need to set the environment variable called PATH. In R
    Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"),
        "path_to_your_BLAST_installation", sep=.Platform$path.sep))
